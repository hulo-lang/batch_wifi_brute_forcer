> This is an experimental project that aims to rewrite the original batch scripts in the [Batch Wi Fi Brute Forcer](https://github.com/TechnicalUserX/batch_wifi_brute_forcer) source code using the [Hulo](https://github.com/hulo-lang) language.
> By transforming imperative shell scripts into declarative Hulo code, the project explores modern script practices and maintainability.
